## Overview

Spark project is a coursework project that I participated during my study of interaction design, along with four other fellow students. It was about a social interaction enhancement device that incorporates gamification, intended to break the social barrier between strangers during an event. It fosters the natural discovery process between individuals and groups by establishing common topics via questionnaire, LED lights and haptic feedback. The project produced MVP system that was demonstrated during faculty exhibition to fellow students and guests.

## The Problem

Many people find social interaction challenging, although they know the importance of it during to build relationship with others. Conversation is the main form of the social interaction, Research revealed possibility of awkward thus unsuccessful interaction was associated with difficulties in initiating social interaction with strangers, as awkward interaction was considered worse than no interaction. The scope of the project was then reduced to interactions in social events instead of social interactions in general.

## The Design

Spark will ask users to enter their basic information and interests before entering the social networking venue. The information entered by the user will then be stored on the LED hat, and the user will also need to wear a necklace with a vibration function. When the user faces other people in a social activity place, the necklace will provide the user with vibration feedback. The stronger the vibration, the more similar interests between the two people. In addition, the hat on the user's head has LED lights, and the colour of each light represents a different kind of interest. However, the user does not know what kind of interest each colour represents. To discover the meaning of LEDs the user must have a conversation with others in the event, who would also be interested in discovering them. By allowing everyone to participate in a guessing game, Spark gives everyone a common conversation topic as well as motivating them to start conversations with others.

“Spark” asks the users to enter their basic information and topics of interests before entering the social networking venue. The user is then given a LED hat and necklace, which are connected to the central control system.
