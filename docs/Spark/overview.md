## Enhancing social interacitons

Sometimes, it can be hard to start a conversation with a stranger because youâ€™re not sure what to talk about. Spark is a proof-of-concept device for a design that enhances social interactions between strangers in an event, by allowing users to play a little guessing game.

Nowadays, some people struggle to socialise and interact with other people at social events. These people do not want to initiate a conversation with strangers due to their fear of having an awkward and thus unsuccessful conversation. Spark aimed to give users the confidence to initiate conversations by informing them how much they share interests and acting as a conversation prop.

Spark will ask users to enter their basic information and interests before entering the social networking venue. The information entered by the user will then be stored on the LED hat, and the user will also need to wear a necklace with a vibration function. When the user faces other people in a social activity place, the necklace will provide the user with vibration feedback. The stronger the vibration, the more similar interests between the two people. In addition, the hat on the user's head has LED lights, and the colour of each light represents a different kind of interest. However, the user does not know what kind of interest each colour represents. To discover the meaning of LEDs the user must have a conversation with others in the event, who would also be interested in discovering them. By allowing everyone to participate in a guessing game, Spark gives everyone a common conversation topic as well as motivating them to start conversations with others.
